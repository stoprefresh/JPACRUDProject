# JPACRUDProject - Beer Listing and Breweries

The old project has changed! Now in addition to being able to add beers to the database, you can also add new breweries as well. If you include a link while building out a new Brewery, you will be able to visit their site through this application. Deletions of either will not affect anything outside of the object you wish to delete. You can also re-assign beers to different breweries if you make a mistake. A default place holder is available if you need time to identify the brewery for your beer.

## Viewing

Use the following link [Beers!](http://marsigliamiguel.com:8080/BootMVCCrudProject/) to view the website.

## Detailed description

 The Project is broken into two file structures. JPACrudProject is set as a Java/Gradle framework, while BootMVCCrudProject utilizes Spring for resource management and display pages. The logic for each of the pages is run through Controllers which set and pass data from the JSP pages to the Java logic portion of the code. Spring allows for the remote access of the Entity that is used throughout.
 The Controllers use a minimumm amount of logic, while most of hard processing is done by the methods in the implementaion class. The use of Spring allows for un-managed transactions.
 New methods have been added and the controller expanded to allow the maniulation of data from the brewery class.
